## Teams & Users

Team represents a set of users who work together. The primary things to know about a team are:

* Teams are the primary mechanism of ownership.
   * Teams own projects where pipelines, datasets and jobs live
   * Teams own execution fabrics that are the resources for execution including your spark clusters and storage
* Users get access via teams
   * For every user, a default team in created that only contains one user. This team is not for sharing, but can be thought of as the personal workspace. 
   * If only one user is to be given access to a project, it can be done via this team
